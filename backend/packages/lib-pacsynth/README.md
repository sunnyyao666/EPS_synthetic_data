# Private Accurate Combination (PAC) Synthesizers

> Library to generate synthetic data for privacy-preserving data sharing and analysis.

Python library exposing a set of synthesizers based on the [Synthetic Data Showcase project](https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase).

These synthesizers aim to replicate the counts of attribute combinations in a sensitive dataset while maintaining differential privacy.

## Available synthesizers

- `DpAggregateSeededSynthesizer`: a differentially-private synthesizer that relies on DP Marginals to build synthetic data. It will compute DP Marginals (called aggregates) for your dataset up to and including a specified `reporting length`, and synthesize data based on the computed aggregated counts.

> For more information about the DP approach please refer to the [DP documentation on SDS](https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase/blob/main/docs/dp/README.md).

## Installation

```bash
pip install pac-synth
```

> If there are no pre-built wheels for your system, you will need Rust tooling installed, so it can be compiled locally.

## Using

> **Check our [detailed](https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase/blob/main/packages/lib-pacsynth/samples/dp_aggregate_seeded_detailed_example.ipynb) and [short](https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase/blob/main/packages/lib-pacsynth/samples/dp_aggregate_seeded_short_example.ipynb) notebook examples for more information.**

```python
from pacsynth import Dataset, DpAggregateSeededParametersBuilder, DpAggregateSeededSynthesizer
from utils import gen_data_frame

# this generates a random pandas data frame with 5000 records
# replace this with your own data
sensitive_df = gen_data_frame(5000)
dataset = Dataset.from_data_frame(sensitive_df)

# build synthesizer
synth = DpAggregateSeededSynthesizer(
	DpAggregateSeededParametersBuilder().epsilon(0.5).build()
)
synth.fit(dataset)

# sample 5000 records and build a data frame
synthetic_raw_data = synth.sample(5000)
synthetic_df = Dataset.raw_data_to_data_frame(synthetic_raw_data)

# show 10 example records
print(synthetic_df.sample(10))

# this will output
#      H1 H2  H3 H4 H5 H6 H7 H8 H9 H10
