## Course project - Engineering Privacy in Software
### Project Overview
With the increasing concerns around privacy, the sensitive information provided by users and collected by companies has raised issues regarding data traceability to individuals. This lack of privacy has potential harmful consequences, such as price discrimination and bias, monetizing users' personal data, monitoring and surveillance. 

To address this issue, our team aims to study ways to reduce the likelihood of personal information being traced back to individuals. We will be undertaking a project that utilizes Microsoft's open source Synthetic Data Showcase tool to enhance privacy when sharing or analyzing data. 

Specifically, we will be utilizing the Yelp dataset provided by Yelp Inc. for our project. This dataset is a subset of Yelpâ€™s businesses, reviews, and user data for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes.

### Contributions
By applying Yelp's dataset on Microsoft's Synthetic Data Showcase library, we have successfully provide an artificial dataset which protects user data rather than releasing the original dataset. Additionally, we developed a user interface for better usability. The privacy-preserving outcomes generated by this tool is better visualized to the users. 

### For users (TBD)
