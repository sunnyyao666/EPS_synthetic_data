# Synthetic Data Generation Using Yelp Dataset

### Engineering Privacy in Software Course project (Team 8)

## Project Overview

Applying [Microsoft's Synthetic Data Showcase Library](https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase) to achieve
more privacy-preserving way of utilizing user data on [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

## Project Description

With the increasing concerns around privacy, the sensitive information provided by users and collected by companies has
raised issues regarding data traceability to individuals. This lack of privacy has potential harmful consequences, such
as price discrimination and bias, monetizing users' personal data, monitoring and surveillance.

To address this issue, our team aims to study ways to reduce the likelihood of personal information being traced back to
individuals. We will be undertaking a project that utilizes Microsoft's open source Synthetic Data Showcase tool to
generate artificial dataset based on the original dataset to enhance privacy when sharing or analyzing user data.

Specifically, we will be utilizing the Yelp dataset provided by Yelp Inc. for our project. This dataset is a subset of
Yelpâ€™s businesses, reviews, and user data for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes.

## Contributions

By applying Yelp's dataset on Microsoft's Synthetic Data Showcase library, we have successfully provided an artificial
dataset along with aggregated statistical data which protects user data
through [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) (a type of privacy-enhancing technology) rather than
releasing the original dataset. Additionally, we developed a user interface for better usability. The privacy-preserving
outcomes generated by this tool is better visualized to the users.

## Set Up Guidance (backend)

Microsoft's Synthetic Data Showcase is based on Rust, and it can be built into Python bindings. Thus, to set up the
backend server you must first install Rust.

### Install Rust

First follow the [steps](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) according to your operating system to install the Rust
tooling.

For macOS, try

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

and follow the on-screen instructions.

To verify the installation, try

```bash
cargo --version
```

in the terminal.

### Install Python and Pip

### Create a virtual env

Go to the `backend` folder, create and use a virtual Python env to install dependencies and run the backend server.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Generate the Python bindings

Install _Maturin_ to build the bindings.

```bash
pip install maturin
```

Go to the `lib-python` package, build and install it as a python module in the current virtual environment.

```bash
cd packages/lib-python
maturin develop --release
```

#### Install the dependencies

Go back to the `backend` folder, and install all the required python dependencies.

```bash
cd ../../
pip install -r packages/pythonpipline/requirements.txt
```

### Run the server

Make sure yor are in the `backend` folder, and run the following command:

```bash
venv/bin/python3 manage.py runserver
```

This will use the virtual env to run the Django backend server on http://localhost:8000/

project:

### EPS Team Members

We would like to thank Hongtao Yao, Gianna Jiang, Thanh Nguyen, and Andrew Berry from the EPS team 8 for their valuable
insights, feedback, and technical assistance during the development of this project.

### Microsoft's Synthetic Data Showcase Library

We would also like to
acknowledge [Microsoft's Synthetic Data Showcase Library](https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase) for
providing the synthetic data tool/library used in this project, which greatly facilitated our analysis and
implementation.

### Yelp Dataset

Finally, we would like to acknowledge the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), which served as the primary
source of data for this project. We appreciate the efforts of Yelp in providing this dataset for research purposes, and
we hope our findings contribute to a better understanding of the restaurant industry.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the success of this project.
